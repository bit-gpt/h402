## Contributing to h402

We created h402 as an open standard by the community, for the community. Your contributions help shape the future of HTTP 402 payments and make it easier for developers and businesses to adopt seamless, protocol-native payment flows.

This document outlines how you can contribute and what weâ€™re currently focused on.

### Examples
We welcome development-ready examples that demonstrate how to implement h402 across different:

- Programming languages
- Frameworks
- Platforms or tools

Our current top priority is expanding the usability of the standard through high-quality examples. These examples should help other developers adopt h402 more easily, please avoid submitting partial implementations or workarounds.

### Schemes
In addition to the default upto scheme, we aim to support a broader variety of payment schemes to enable diverse use cases in commerce and finance.

When contributing new schemes:
- Follow the core h402 design principles: interoperability, clarity, and reusability.
- Ensure your scheme can be adapted across different implementations.
- Proposals will be reviewed collaboratively with the h402 team and relevant business stakeholders.

### Chains

h402 is chain-agnostic by design. We encourage contributions that:
- Add support for new blockchains
- Improve existing chain integrations

New chain implementations will be reviewed by the h402 team, and, when possible, in collaboration with the corresponding chain foundations.
